Paper by Pappas, K. et al, 2018 related Epigenetic  regulation of PTEN expression in breast cancer

We provide here different command lines to visualise the genomic and epigenomic regulation loci of PTEN using R bioconductor packages coMET and Gviz and published data :
1) COSMIC data for genetic variants associated with Breast cancer
2) ENSEMBL for the exonic/intronic structures of different genes
3) Pappas et al., 2017, "p53 Maintains Baseline Expression of Multiple Tumor Suppressor Genes" http://mcr.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2017/05/06/1541-7786.MCR-17-0089 for binding site of P53
4) chromHMM for 5 breast cell-lines published by Pellacani et al., 2017, "Analysis of Normal Human Mammary Epigenomes Reveals Cell-Specific Active Enhancer States and Associated Transcription Factor Networks"
5) ATAC-seq data in MCF10A cell-line from Liu et al, 2017, "Identification of breast cancer associated variants that modulate transcription factor binding" 
6) DNase-seq of  MCF7 cell-line from ENCODE
